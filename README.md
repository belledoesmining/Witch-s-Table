This texture pack was made for stall in TallTalesRP! Its content is mostly wands, but when the group decideds to we'll make more items! The purpose is to create a beautiful environment, make the server more inclusive in a way, and show what great minds can bring up when they work together!

Most of the Wand items you can just place in your off hand to see. You can attach them to your head, but that a little silly!

CIT is required!! https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn

None of the textures are to be made on your own. You would have to buy them in game.

You may be wondering if you stumble upon this and your not to sure why this was made? Well heres a brief description of TallTalesRP.
